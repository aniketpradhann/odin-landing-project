# Odin Landing Page Project

This project is a landing page created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The objective was to practice basic HTML and CSS skills while designing a simple, responsive webpage.

This landing page is not perfect, and some aspects may need further refinement. I plan to make improvements as I continue to learn.
